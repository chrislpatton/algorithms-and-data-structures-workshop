## Strings
### Check if input string is palindrome
  Implement this task both way (recursion and iterative way)

### Check if two given strings are isomorphic to each other
Two strings str1 and str2 are called isomorphic if there is a one to one mapping possible for every character of str1 to every character of str2. And all occurrences of every character in ‘str1′ map to same character in ‘str2′

  Input:

   `str1 = "aab",
    str2 = "xxy"`
  Output:

   `True ('a' is mapped to 'x' and 'b' is mapped to 'y')`

  Input:  

    `str1 = "aab",
     str2 = "xyz"`  

  Output:

   `False (One occurrence of 'a' in str1 has 'x' in str2 and other occurrence of 'a' has 'y')`
