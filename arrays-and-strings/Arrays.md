### Given a binary string, count number of substrings that start and end with 1
Given a binary string, count number of substrings that start and end with 1.
Example
  Input:

    `“00100101”`

  Output:

    `3 ( “1001”, “100101” and “101”)`

### Subsets problems
Given a set of distinct integers, return all possible subsets.
Elements in a subset must be in non-descending order. The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets.

  Input:

    `[1,2,3]`

  Output:

    `[[3],[1],[2],[1,2,3],[1,3],[2,3],[1,2]]`

### Two sum problem
The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2.Please note that your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.

  Input:

    `[3,5,2,-4,8,11], target=7`

  Output:

    `[[2, 3], [4, -6]]`

### K-th Smallest/Largest Element in Unsorted Array
  Given array of unsorted elements and index of element. Find k-th smallest and largest element.
