## Stacks
### Balanced Parentheses
Given a sequence consisting of parentheses, determine whether the expression is balanced. A sequence of parentheses is balanced if every open parentheses can be paired uniquely with a closed parentheses that occurs after the former. You will be given three types of parentheses: (, {, and [. Return true or false.
  Examples:

    {[()]} - This is a balanced parentheses.
    {[(])} - This is not a balanced parentheses.

### Find maximum element in stack

Design a Data Structure SpecialStack which inheritance from Stack and have all stack operations like push, pop, empty. Implement additional operation get_max, which should return maximum element from SpecialStack. This operation
must be O(1). To implement get_max, you should only use standard Stack and no other data structure like arrays, .. etc.
